 POLITICS_MATTEW_II_DESC:0 "Long gone is the age absolute Monarchist power that was enjoyed by the house of Veislava. For centuries has their great house held the title of the oldest living Monarchy in the history of the world, but that title is soon to be contested from all sides. Mattew is an old man, he has attempted to keep the nation under control for most of his life and it has taken a toll on his body and soul. Despised by the Old Guard for his liberal inclinations, hated by the Communists for his position as a Monarch and under constant pressure by the masses to further liberalize the crippled semi-absolutist monarchy. The future of Mattew is unknown."

Assending power in 1922 after his fathers death, his reign has been busy. The 1926 Barxia war with Lusjki was his fireproof, which was greatly won by the Mursian troops. Since then, he has used his anti-communist and nationalist platform to opress opposition to his political intervetions. His sceming has greatly impacted the political landscape in the country; not only did it saw the rise of the MPP and Martinites, but also Katá-Vasiliko which was formed as a direct response to the former. Now Martin has come in a thight space. Will he break out of it and reign free? Or will republicanism call the end of the U Mursya supremacy?"
