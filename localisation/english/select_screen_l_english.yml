 SEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A proud and hardy people, the Narangol rode out from the Torbroklan under the god emperor Songoson to build one of the greatest empires in the world. Through sheer cunning and brutality, the Narangol houses on their vast estates endured and thrived. None however could foresee the forces of industrialisation and modern war that would reshape their world. The fossilised aristocrats waving their heirloom swords, and the self-made men that arose to supplant them, both plunged the nation into the hell of the Grand Campaigns. What was sold as a new round of glorious conquests soon devolved into catastrophic defeat and chaos as the empire tore apart at its seams.\nWhile the guns and artillery of Kodeshia and Akiteiwa fell silent, the gunners of Selengeria turned inward. Five blood soaked years ensued as brother turned on brother and forces loyal to the liberal imperial government fought the Undserkheg nationalists of Khiyad Suudrin. And as the Narangol drowned the streets of Sukhbaatar in their own blood, long oppressed minorities around the edges of the empire rose up to reclaim their freedom. Out of this chaos, Suudrin would eventually emerge victorious in 1929 and go on to transform Selengeria into a totalitarian dictatorship.\nSixteen years later and tensions remain high in the east. The nightmares of war have faded and the hot-blooded Jonon and his generals are growing restless. Constant provocations on all sides are roiling the region and Selengeria’s neighbours grow more alarmed by the hour as Suudrin steps up efforts to reintegrate his 'rebellious provinces'. Has Selengeria learned the lessons of the Grand Campaigns, or will Suudrin call upon the Red God and unleash hell once more on Kesh?"
