 #----------- Ideas ---------------------------------------------------------
 Martin_I:0 "Martin I"
 Martin_I_desc:0 "Overlord of Bonamech and Traxí, Duke of Circe, Heleovo and Visia. Also known as 'Martin the Stern', Martin I is the de facto king of Mursland. Assending power in 1922 after his fathers death, his reign has been busy. The 1926 Barxia war with Lusjki was his fireproof, which was greatly won by the Mursian troops. Since then, he has used his nationalist and anti-communist platform to oppress opposition to his political interventions. His scheming has greatly impacted the political landscape in the country; not only did it saw the rise of the MPP and Martinites, but also Katá-Vasiliko which was formed as a direct response to the former."
 Arkady_III:0 "Arkady III"
 Arkady_III_desc:0 "Overlord of Bonamech and Traxí, Duke of Circe, Heleovo and Visia, de facto king of Mursland. Arkady Kristiyan Hristofor is the oldest son of Martin I. Although sharing blood, they do not share much in political view. Arkady is less politically engaged as his father, but more so with the militairy, specifically the air force."
 Succesor_Crisis:0 "Succesor Crisis"
 Succesor_Crisis_desc:0 "With the recent death of Martin, a replacement has to be found quickly. Obvious is the crownprince Arkady Kristiyan, but his high-fly temprament and aggresive stance on Mursland in international politics makes him an undesired character in government official circles. Perhaps, a different solution can be found..."

 Support_republicanism:0 "Support Republicanism"
 Support_the_crown:0 "Support Monarchism"
 Support_democracy:0 "Support Democracy"
 privitizing_businesses:0 "Privitize Businesses"
 privitizing_businesses_dec:0 "After abdication of Mihalou II (1869-1930, rule 1912-1922) many businesses and lands in private ownership of the royal family were nationalized. A large part of these companies were privitized from the 30s onwards to finance the 'Act of Education Support'. This enabled many families to send their children to highschool while still recieving an income. These funds have now run to their ends, so the last of the state-owned companies will have to be sold to give the final boost needed for the program."
 woman_recruitment1:0 "Woman recruitment"
 woman_recruitment1_desc:0 "Since 1915, women have been allowed to join the service, with recruitment starting in 1920. Although they did not see deployment in the Grand Campaigns, they did fight in the Braxia Conflict in support battalions. To this day, a significant number of young women still serve the army in technical, administrative and medical services."
 woman_recruitment2:0 "Woman recruitment"
 woman_recruitment2_desc:0 "The threat of war has deemed it necessary to not only start active recruitment of men, but of women too. By allowing them to be active in frontline units more, a better propaganda system can be set up, motivating more ladies to join the armed forces!"
 woman_recruitment3:0 "Woman recruitment"
 woman_recruitment3_desc:0 "The situation has become dire, and all women will have to join the armed forces to bring glory to our nation!"

 Backstab_politics:0 "Backstab politics"
 Backstab_politics_desc:0 "The political climate in Mursland is very turbulent. Politicans are plotting behind each others back, votes are blocked for no reason, and scandals are made of every small inconvience. And to make matters worse - Overlord Martin is involved as well!"

 Protests_in_traxia:0 "Protests in Traxia"
 Protests_in_traxia_desc:0 "The value crash of the Pette and unfair distribution of economic resources has caused large unemployment rates in the Traxia region, mostly along the native population. People have amassed on the streets of cities across the region, and the atmosphere is getting grim. We have to take action soon!"

The bomb had been set up to detonate when the office chair would be pulled back. \n\nHowever, it was not Martin who pulled the chair back, but Kaloyan Vaneus, one of the assistants of the Council of State. While Kaloyan was killed instantly by the blast, Martin was only hit by the fragmentation from the desktop. Although no official record has yet been made public, it was reported that between 20 and 65 shards entered the body of the king. \n\nHis condition appears to be highly critical as he was rushed to the hospital.

The power of the royal house might be limited by the constitution, this has not stopped him from influencing politicians to do his bidding. Bribery, chantage and false promises are everyday activities of our 'king'. \n\nLuckily for democracy, he is opposed by the republicans, under the name of Katá-Vasiliko. Formed as a protest movement against Martin's statements, they now are the largest party in the Province-Room. They goal - depose of the king!\n\nBut soon, they will discover there is more going on than just radical speeches."
